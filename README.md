# Palm_Oil_Recovery



## Study info:

There are 16 samples from each of 5 plots. All plots are from a palm oil plantation that is undergoing [rewilding](https://alittlewild.com/#rec523988346).

**Plots:**

  - P5 is oil palm, still farmed
  - P4 is an area where all the oil palm trees have been removed â€“ has been like this for 1yr (left fallow)
  - P3 a managed plot that has been managed/plated for three years (e.g., three years since clearing)
  - P2 a managed plot that has been managed/plated for two years (e.g., two years since clearing)
  - P1 a managed plot that has been managed/plated for one years (e.g., one years since clearing)

Using Plot (P3) three as an example, it was palm oil originally, was cleared, and has been managed for three years.

**In all plots they follow the same regime:**

  - Palm oil production
  - Area cleared and left fallow for a year
  - Then they plant crops

All started off as palm oil, then spent a year clear and left alone before planting
